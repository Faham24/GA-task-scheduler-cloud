This project implements a Genetic Algorithm (GA)-based task scheduling algorithm for cloud computing using the CloudSim simulation environment. The goal is to optimize the allocation of tasks to virtual machines (VMs) by considering key parameters such as:

 **Task Computation Time**,
 **Task Deadlines**,
 **Resource Availability**

The algorithm is evaluated based on:
 Makespan (Total execution time),
 Utilization (Efficient use of resources),
 Energy Consumption
