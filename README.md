This project implements a Genetic Algorithm (GA)-based task scheduling algorithm for cloud computing using the CloudSim simulation environment. The goal is to optimize the allocation of tasks to virtual machines (VMs) by considering key scheduling parameters.

Features
Optimizes task scheduling using Genetic Algorithm (GA).
Considers key parameters such as:

Task Computation Time

Task Deadlines

Resource Availability
Evaluates performance based on:

Makespan (Total execution time)

Utilization (Efficient resource usage)

Energy Consumption

Technologies Used
Java (Programming Language)

CloudSim (Cloud simulation framework)

Genetic Algorithm (GA) (Optimization technique)
